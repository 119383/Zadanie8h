To run this project, simply clone the stuff from this repository. Then open the project using Apache NetBeans 11.1 or any other IDE of your choice and then press RMB on the project and press "Run Tests". 

The time to create all the test cases here was quite limited and I sadly did not have time to add all the features I would like this program to have - especially considering how much time I have wasted on configuring Cucumber, which eventually I did not manage to successfuly do.
